      This is a FAQ for the client.
	  Some frecuently asked questions are:
	 
	  1- Can I change the style of the application? Yes, you can. If you click on the "Estilos" button, a new window will pop in which there'll be a combobox where you can choose between 5 different unique styles.
	  
	  2- Can I set an alarm? Yes, you can. If you click on the "Alarma" button, a new window will pop, where you'll have to set the hour, minute, day and date for the alarm, apart from, of course, its text.
	  
	  3- Can I delete an email? Sadly, as of today, no, you cant. Even though there is a "Borrar" button, it doesnt work yet. Nonetheless, that will be the next feature I'll implement, I promise!
